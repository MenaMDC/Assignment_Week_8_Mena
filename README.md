## ðŸ“Œ For Professor Lee : Quick Glance General Notes
-  I used the sample image provided in your repository (2 grandparents with 2 grandchildren), however, they are wearing prescription eyeglasses, and the model is not very good at detecting it.  We made adjustments (using Cursor) to try and fix this.  We tried several adjustments, such as histogram equalization, Haar cascade, and CLAHE.  In the end, we got it to work a bit, but it's not 100% on the eyeglasses.  However, all main objectives for assignment were achieved, and learning has taken place.  Perhaps trying a completely different model and making adjustments.  However, the current mission objectives were completed, and I have learned.  Thank you.
