## ðŸ“Œ For Professor Lee : Quick Glance General Notes
-  I used the sample image provided in your repository (2 grandparents with 2 grandchildren), however, they are wearing prescription eyeglasses, and the model is not very good at detecting it.  We made adjustments (using Cursor) to try and fix this.  We tried several adjustments, such as histogram equalization, Haar cascade, and CLAHE.  In the end, we got it to work a bit, but it's not 100% on the eyeglasses. Perhaps trying a completely different model and making adjustments.  However,  within our current assignment parameters, all main mission objectives were completed.  Thank you.
